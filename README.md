# Rosalind: Bioinformatics Stronghold Problems

This repository consists of coding solutions for problems in the [Bioinformatics Stronghold](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/) set from Rosalind. The main purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my basic coding skills relevant to biological sequences to those who look to understand my coding style prior to interviewing me for a role applying these skills. Besides reviewing my ability to solve basic bioinformatics problems, feel free to look into my other repositories dealing with sequence analyses.
