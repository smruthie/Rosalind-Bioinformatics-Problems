# Rosalind: Bioinformatics Stronghold Problems

This repository consists of coding solutions for the problems in the Bioinformatics Stronghold set in Rosalind platform. The main purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my basic coding skills relevant to biological sequences to companies who look to understand my coding style prior to interviewing me. Besides reviewing my ability to solve basic bioinformatics problems, feel free to look into my other repositories dealing with sequence analyses.
